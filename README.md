# Consistent Physics Informed Neural Networks

This repository contains a demonstration of the consistent PINNs methodology for solving PDEs using neural networks, which designs a loss function by discretizing the Sobolev norms appearing in the PDE regularity theory. A detailed description of the method can be found in the paper:
